Web Sprint Challenge: User Interface and Git

Self-Study Questions

1. Semantic HTML is to structure each web page on a website in such a way that the browser
udnerstands what the content is; it helps with accessibility as well. It includes tags like
<form>, <p>, <header>, <h#> (headings), <table>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and many 
more. These tags provide information about the actual content of the website unlike <div> 
and <span>.

2. display: block; displays content/elements on a new line like a <p> or <div>. 
display: inline; does not create a new line for content/elements, similar to <span>.
display: block; does not allow any elements to be on the same line with it and forces
white space around it. display: inline; is displayed in the same block element it is in.

3. Inner to Outer: content, padding, border, margin.

4. align-items: center; will display the content on the center of the y-axis, whereas
justify-content is for aligning content on the x-axis.

5. Git is valuable because it provides a trail of i) what changes have been made on a
project over time; ii) who made those changes; and iii) why those changes were made. Git
also allows for better collaboration and communication between developers. One can see all
versions of a project and revert to older versions if necessary.
